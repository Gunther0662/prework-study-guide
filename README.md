# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My Prework study Guide webpage was created for a way to put important information relating to the topic of coding. HTML, GIT, and JavaScript are concepts new to me so I needed to find space where I can type important information regarding im learning.
This webpage makes it easier for the students learning about coding to study for a exam. As well as, this study guide was created by me so I can pratice my coding skills.
Hopefully by me publishing this webpage I can reach out to more egard student trying to learn about coding.
By creating this webpage I learn that every webpage in the internet was created by somebody from the beginnig. I was able to practice my coding skills and creat my first ever webpage from the ground up.

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
